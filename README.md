# Wildfire-Equity-Impact-Project

# 🌲 Evacuation Equity Index & Prescribed Fire Stress Tests

**Using WatchDuty wildfire data to identify and address inequities in evacuation systems before real wildfires occur.**

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project develops a **reproducible framework** to measure and visualize disparities in wildfire evacuation systems using:

- **Evacuation Equity Index (EEI)** — combining alert latency, coverage, and community vulnerability.
- **Prescribed Fires as Stress Tests** — using past controlled burns to detect inequities before emergencies.
- **Interactive Dashboards** — to help agencies prioritize interventions in vulnerable tracts.

📝 Target audience: Public agencies, fire responders, and community organizations aiming to pilot equity-centered evacuation improvements within 1–2 fire seasons.
